# Anoma

Anoma is a unified architecture for full-stack decentralized applications, enabling intent-centric interactions, counterparty discovery, and multi-party atomic settlement.

# Overview

Anoma provides a novel architecture centered around intents, allowing users to express preferences and enabling decentralized matching and settlement. It combines counterparty discovery, solving, and settlement in a unified platform.

# Benefits

- **Intent-Centric Design**: Enables expressive user preferences and counterparty discovery
- **Unified Architecture**: Integrates discovery, solving, and settlement layers
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Supports transparent, shielded, and private state/operations
- **Flexible Security**: Allows heterogeneous security models with a homogeneous architecture  
- **Novel Primitives**: Introduces concepts like fractal instances and validity predicates

# Key Features

## Validity Predicates

Allow users and applications to define rules governing state changes, enabling safe interactions between mutually distrusting programs.

## Fractal Instances

Sovereign instances of Anoma consensus and execution protocols, enabling flexible security and scalability.

Anoma revolutionizes decentralized application development by providing a unified, intent-centric architecture that enables novel use cases and improves user experience across the Web3 ecosystem.
