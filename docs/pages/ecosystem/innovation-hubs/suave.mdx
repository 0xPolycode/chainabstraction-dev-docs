# SUAVE

## What is SUAVE?

SUAVE (Single Unifying Auction for Value Expression) is a decentralized platform for fast and private off-chain computation. It enables building blocks on other chains, defining private compute, storing private data, and accessing off-chain data.

### Overview

SUAVE revolutionizes blockchain interactions by providing a platform for MEV (Miner Extractable Value) infrastructure and confidential computation. It differs from existing blockchains through programmable privacy, credible off-chain computation, and faster block times.

## Key Features

- **Block Building**: Build blocks on other chains.
- **Private Compute**: Define and execute private computations.
- **Private Data Storage**: Store confidential data securely.
- **Off-chain Data Access**: Interface with external data sources.
- **MEV Infrastructure**: Integrate with existing MEV components or build new ones.

# Architecture

## Kettle

The primary protocol actor, containing a modified Geth node (MEVM) and a confidential data store.

## SUAVE Chain

Runs public state, currently using Clique POA Consensus.

## Confidential Compute Requests

Used to access private state through a modified RPC in each Kettle.

# Key Differences

## Programmable Privacy

Enables confidential computations and data handling.

## Credible Off-chain Computation

Allows for trustworthy computations outside the main blockchain.

## Faster Block Time

Offers improved transaction speed compared to Ethereum L1.

# Applications (SUAPPs)

## Smart Contracts on SUAVE

Similar to dApps on Ethereum, with additional privacy features.

## Confidential Transactions

Transactions can contain data encrypted for specific actors.

# Benefits

- Enables sophisticated MEV strategies
- Provides a platform for confidential blockchain computations
- Allows for faster and more efficient block building
- Supports integration with various MEV infrastructures

SUAVE empowers developers and MEV searchers with a powerful platform for confidential computations and advanced MEV strategies, potentially reshaping the landscape of blockchain value extraction and privacy.
