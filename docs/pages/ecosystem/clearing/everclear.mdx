## What is Everclear?

Everclear is a novel public good mechanism for settling intents across chains. It acts as a clearing layer, facilitating efficient rebalancing for solvers in intent-based protocols.

### Overview

Everclear revolutionizes cross-chain intent settlement by socializing rebalancing costs, providing a programmable layer for various settlement mechanisms, and enabling permissionless expansion to new chains and rollups.

## Key Features

- **Cost Socialization**: Allows fillers to share rebalancing costs across the network.
- **Programmable Layer**: Supports various rebalancing and settlement mechanisms.
- **Permissionless Expansion**: Enables any application on any chain to onboard users from other chains.
- **Netting Mechanism**: Reduces rebalancing costs by up to 10x through efficient netting of intents.

# How It Works

## Rebalancing Process

1. Rebalancers deposit funds into Spoke contracts on supported chains.
2. The Hub contract on the Clearing chain nets intents against others moving in opposite directions.
3. Un-netted intents are discounted over time to attract Arbitrageurs.

## Discount Mechanism

- Intents are discounted by a configured BPS per epoch.
- Arbitrageurs can purchase discounted intents for profit.
- Competition among Arbitrageurs leads to optimal pricing for Rebalancers.

# Benefits

## For Solvers

- Reduced rebalancing costs
- Simplified cross-chain operations
- Programmatic rebalancing opportunities

## For Users

- Cheaper intent fulfillment
- Improved liquidity across chains

# Vision

Everclear aims to unlock the potential of the multi-chain future by solving the rebalancing problem, supporting the growth of intent-based systems and the expansion of layer 2 and 3 chains.

Everclear provides a crucial infrastructure layer for the growing ecosystem of intent-based protocols, facilitating efficient cross-chain operations and liquidity management.
