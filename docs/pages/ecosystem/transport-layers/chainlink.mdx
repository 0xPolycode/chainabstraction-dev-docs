# Chainlink CCIP

## What is Chainlink CCIP?

Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) is a blockchain interoperability protocol that enables developers to build secure applications for transferring tokens, messages, or both across different blockchain networks.

### Overview

Chainlink CCIP revolutionizes cross-chain interactions by providing a secure, flexible, and efficient protocol for blockchain interoperability. It leverages Chainlink's established oracle networks and implements multiple layers of security to ensure safe cross-chain transactions.

## Key Features

- **Arbitrary Messaging**: Send any data across chains to trigger actions on receiving smart contracts.
- **Token Transfer**: Transfer tokens between different blockchains.
- **Programmable Token Transfer**: Simultaneously transfer tokens and data in a single transaction.
- **Multi-layered Security**: Implements defense-in-depth security measures.

# Core Capabilities

## Arbitrary Messaging

Enables sending encoded data to smart contracts on different blockchains, allowing complex multi-chain operations.

## Token Transfer

Supports transferring tokens to smart contracts or EOAs on different blockchains.

## Programmable Token Transfer

Combines token transfers with arbitrary data, enabling complex instructions along with token movement.

# Security Measures

- Multiple independent nodes run by separate key holders.
- Three decentralized networks verifying every cross-chain transaction.
- Separation of responsibilities between node operators.
- Diverse software clients for increased decentralization.
- Novel risk management system with level-5 security.

# Use Cases
