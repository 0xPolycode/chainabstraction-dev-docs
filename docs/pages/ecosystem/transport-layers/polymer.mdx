# Polymer

## What is Polymer?

Polymer is an interoperability hub built as a rollup on Ethereum, designed to connect various Ethereum rollups using the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. It combines the Cosmos SDK with the OP Stack to create a unique solution for cross-rollup communication.

### Overview

Polymer revolutionizes interoperability for Ethereum rollups by bringing the robust IBC standard to the Ethereum ecosystem. It acts as a specialized rollup focused on providing secure and efficient cross-chain communication.

## Key Features

- **Ethereum Security**: Shares the same security foundation as other Ethereum rollups.
- **Native IBC Interoperability**: Ports the IBC standard into the Ethereum ecosystem.
- **Scalable Connectivity**: Specializes in providing low-cost, high-scalability interoperability services.

# Technical Architecture

## OP Stack Integration

- Uses the OP Stack as the rollup framework.
- Leverages the flexibility of the OP Stack to use custom execution engines.

## Cosmos SDK as Execution Engine

- Implements the Cosmos SDK as the execution layer within the OP Stack.
- Utilizes the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI) to connect the Cosmos SDK with the OP Stack.

## Virtual IBC

- Implements virtual IBC as the core application-specific component.
- Enables Ethereum rollups to communicate via IBC without native implementation.

# Key Components

## Rollup Node

- Derives L2 blocks from L1 data.
- Can operate in verifying, participating, or sequencing modes.

## Data Availability

- Initially uses Ethereum L1, with plans to move to EigenDA.

## Polymer Appchain

- Built as a Cosmos SDK ABCI app within the OP Stack.
- Specializes in interoperability functions.

# Benefits

- Provides a standardized interoperability solution for Ethereum rollups.
- Enables seamless communication between Ethereum rollups and IBC-enabled chains.
- Reduces the cost and complexity of cross-chain interactions.

Polymer aims to become the central hub for interoperability in the Ethereum ecosystem, bridging the gap between Ethereum rollups and the broader blockchain landscape through IBC.
