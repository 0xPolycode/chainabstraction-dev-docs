# Wormhole

## What is Wormhole?

Wormhole is a generic message passing protocol that enables communication between different blockchains. It's not a blockchain itself or a token bridge, but a foundational layer for cross-chain applications.

### Overview

Wormhole revolutionizes blockchain interoperability by providing a secure and efficient protocol for passing messages between different blockchain networks. It enables developers to build applications that leverage the advantages of multiple ecosystems.

## Key Features

- **Generic Message Passing**: Enables any type of data or instruction to be sent across chains.
- **Cross-Chain Communication**: Facilitates interaction between different blockchain networks.
- **Flexibility**: Supports various use cases from exchanges to governance and gaming.

# Core Components

## On-Chain Components

- **Emitter**: Contract that publishes messages to the Core Contract.
- **Wormhole Core Contract**: Primary contract observed by Guardians.
- **Transaction Logs**: Blockchain-specific logs for message observation.

## Off-Chain Components

- **Guardian Network**: Validators that observe and validate cross-chain messages.
- **Spy**: Daemon for observing and forwarding network traffic.
- **API**: REST server for retrieving VAA and network details.
- **VAAs**: Verifiable Action Approvals, signed attestations of observed messages.
- **Relayers**: Processes that deliver VAAs to target chains.

# Use Cases

## Cross-Chain Exchange

Build exchanges with access to liquidity from multiple chains.

## Cross-Chain Governance

Enable voting across different blockchain networks.

## Cross-Chain Gaming

Create games that span multiple blockchains for various functionalities.

# Architecture

- Utilizes a network of Guardians for message validation.
- Employs VAAs for secure cross-chain message passing.
- Supports both standard and specialized relayers for message delivery.

Wormhole provides developers with a powerful toolkit for building truly cross-chain applications, enabling seamless interaction between different blockchain ecosystems.
