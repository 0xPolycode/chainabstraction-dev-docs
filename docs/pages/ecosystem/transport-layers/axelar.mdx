# Axelar

## What is Axelar?

Axelar is a secure interoperability platform that enables token transfers and communication across different blockchains, regardless of their consensus mechanisms or message payloads. It operates on a proof-of-stake security model similar to many of the chains it connects.

### Overview

Axelar revolutionizes cross-chain interactions by providing a permissionless and censorship-resistant infrastructure for interchain applications. It simplifies the process of sending tokens and messages between different blockchain networks.

## Key Features

- **Secure Token Transfers**: Enables safe movement of tokens across various blockchains.
- **Cross-Chain Communication**: Facilitates message passing between different blockchain networks.
- **Permissionless Architecture**: Ensures transactions cannot be censored by oracles, relayers, or validators.
- **Proof-of-Stake Security**: Utilizes a robust security model similar to connected chains.

# Core Functionalities

## Interchain Transactions

- `callContract()`: Send messages without tokens across chains.
- `callContractWithToken()`: Send messages along with ERC-20 tokens across chains.

## Gas Management

- `AxelarGasService`: Handles gas payments for cross-chain transactions.

## Transaction Monitoring

- Axelarscan: Dedicated blockchain explorer for executing, recovering, or checking transaction status.

# Developer Tools

## Token Management

- Create new Interchain Tokens
- Upgrade existing ERC-20 tokens to Interchain Tokens

## Cross-Chain Operations

- Send tokens between different blockchains
- Implement rate limits for cross-chain token transfers
- Call smart contracts on other chains with or without token attachments

## Development Resources

- `axelar-examples`: Sample cross-chain apps
- `foundry-axelar-gmp-example`: Foundry framework integration
- AxelarJS SDK: npm library for APIs and query tools
- `axelar-local-dev`: Local cross-chain development environment

Axelar provides developers with a comprehensive suite of tools and resources to build secure, efficient, and truly interoperable blockchain applications across multiple networks.
