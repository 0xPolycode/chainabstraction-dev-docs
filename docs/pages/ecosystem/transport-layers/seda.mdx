# SEDA Network

## What is SEDA?

SEDA (Secure Data Access) is a data transmission and computation network that goes beyond traditional oracle functionality. It provides a permissionless environment for developers to deploy and utilize data feeds with advanced computational capabilities.

### Overview

SEDA revolutionizes blockchain data access by offering a modular, permissionless network for fetching, computing, and delivering data across multiple blockchain networks. It combines secure data transmission with off-chain computation to enable complex data operations for blockchain applications.

## Key Components

- **SEDA Chain**: Used for settlement and data storage for distribution.
- **Overlay Network**: Multi-Party Computation (MPC) network for data querying and computation.
- **Solvers**: Entities forwarding data requests and results between chains.
- **Data Providers**: Private entities supplying data to the SEDA Network.

# Key Features

- **Multi-Chain Native**: Compatible with various blockchain networks.
- **Fast and Scalable**: Efficient data processing and delivery.
- **Proof-of-Stake for Data Provision**: Secure and incentivized data provision.
- **Permissionless**: Open access for all participants.
- **Highly Programmable**: Customizable data feeds and computations.
- **Forkless Upgrades**: Seamless network improvements.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven decision making.
- **Oracle Extractable Value (OEV)**: New revenue stream for data providers.

# Core Functionalities

## Data Transmission

Enables secure and efficient transfer of data from various sources to destination blockchains.

## Off-Chain Computation

Allows complex computations on fetched data before delivery to smart contracts.

## Incentivized Data Provision

Data providers earn revenue based on data utilization and value.

# Benefits for Developers

- Access to both public and private data sources.
- Ability to perform complex off-chain computations.
- Customizable data feeds and computation instructions.
- Seamless integration with various blockchain networks.

SEDA provides a comprehensive solution for blockchain data needs, offering developers powerful tools to access, compute, and utilize data across multiple networks in a secure and efficient manner.
