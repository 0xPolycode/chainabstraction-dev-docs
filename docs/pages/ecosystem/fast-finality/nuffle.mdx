# NFFL (Nuffle Fast Finality Layer)

NFFL is a fast settlement layer enabling quick and secure cross-network information access for participating networks. It leverages NEAR and EigenLayer to provide interoperability features secured by staked ETH.

# Overview

NFFL combines EigenLayer's Actively Validated Service architecture with NEAR Data Availability to enable fast finality and secure cross-chain communications. It uses restaked ETH for economic security and NEAR DA for storing rollup block data.

# Key Features

## EigenLayer AVS Integration

Utilizes EigenLayer's Actively Validated Service for coordinating validators and providing economic security.

## NEAR Data Availability

Stores rollup block data on NEAR, enabling fast and public access to network state.

# Benefits

- **Fast Finality**: Enables quick cross-network state verification
- **Enhanced Security**: Leverages EigenLayer's restaked ETH for economic security
- **Interoperability**: Facilitates seamless cross-chain communications
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple participating networks
- **Flexible Integration**: Easily integrable with existing rollup architectures

NFFL revolutionizes cross-chain interactions by providing a fast, secure settlement layer that enables quick access to information across participating networks.
