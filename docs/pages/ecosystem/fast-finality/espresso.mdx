# Espresso

Espresso is a sequencing and coordination layer that facilitates interactions across blockchain ecosystems. It provides fast finality and efficient cross-chain operations through a shared network and marketplace.

# Overview

Espresso enables seamless cross-chain interactions through its shared network and marketplace. It uses the HotShot consensus protocol to provide fast finality and a decentralized sequencing layer.

# Benefits

- **Fast Finality**: Achieve cross-chain finality within seconds
- **Increased Security**: Shared decentralized consensus bolsters ecosystem security
- **Revenue Optimization**: Chains can sell sequencing rights to maximize revenue
- **Seamless Interoperability**: Minimize friction in cross-chain operations
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple chains and applications

# Key Features

## Espresso Network

Shared source of truth providing fast finality on transaction ordering and data across chains using the HotShot consensus protocol.

## Espresso Marketplace

Market for chains to sell transaction sequencing rights to block builders, optimizing revenue and interoperability.
