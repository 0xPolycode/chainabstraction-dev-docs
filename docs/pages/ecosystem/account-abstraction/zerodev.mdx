# ZeroDev

## What is ZeroDev?

ZeroDev is a smart, white-labeled, and modular embedded wallet designed to enhance Web3 user experiences, particularly in DeFi applications. It leverages account abstraction (AA) to provide a user-friendly and customizable wallet solution without compromising security.

### Key Features

- **Smart**: Utilizes account abstraction to offer advanced features that make Web3 feel like Web2, such as social logins, gas sponsorship, and transaction automation.

- **White-labeled**: ZeroDev does not include a user interface, allowing developers to create fully customized experiences on top of its underlying wallet logic.

- **Modular**: Built on Kernel, the leading open-source smart account, ZeroDev supports ERC-7579 plugins for extensive customization of wallet logic.

### What ZeroDev offers?

Account abstraction (AA) is crucial for creating a Web3 experience that matches the convenience and usability of Web2 while maintaining security. With AA, developers can:

- **Create Self-Custody Wallets**: Enable users to log in with familiar Web2 credentials such as social accounts, email, or passkeys, eliminating the need for seed phrases.

- **Sponsor Gas**: Allow users to transact without worrying about gas fees by sponsoring gas or enabling payment in ERC20 tokens like USDC or project-specific tokens.

- **Simplify User Flow**: Streamline the user experience by batching transactions, removing unnecessary signing prompts, and automating transactions, even when users are offline.

- **Recover Wallets**: Provide users with the ability to recover their wallets if they lose their keys.

These features are just the beginning; ZeroDev's programmability allows for additional enhancements through custom plugins.

### Why ZeroDev?

- **Powerful**: Supports all major account abstraction features, including gas sponsorship and transaction batching, along with powerful plugins like session keys, recovery, and passkeys.

- **Modular**: As the first AA SDK with native plugin support, ZeroDev allows developers to customize wallet logic by creating and integrating custom plugins.

- **Interoperable**: Built on top of Viem and Permissionless, ZeroDev ensures compatibility with standard Viem APIs and any AA infrastructure providers, preventing vendor lock-in.
