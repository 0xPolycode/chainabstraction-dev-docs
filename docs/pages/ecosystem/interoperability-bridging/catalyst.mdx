# Catalyst

## What is Catalyst?

Catalyst is a permissionless liquidity engine designed for the modular future of blockchain technology. It's a cross-chain automated market maker (AMM) that facilitates atomic native asset swaps between different chains, deployable on any chain and connecting liquidity from various ecosystems.

### Overview

Catalyst revolutionizes cross-chain interactions by providing a global liquidity layer that automatically connects chains as they launch. It aims to create an interconnected ecosystem where users can easily access assets and applications across multiple chains, and developers can effortlessly launch and connect new blockchains.

## Key Features

- **Permissionless Liquidity**: Enables automatic connection to any new chain, democratizing access to blockchain liquidity.
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Facilitates seamless communication and liquidity movement between different blockchain networks.
- **Unit of Liquidity (UoL)**: An innovative concept that allows for universal value comprehension between Catalyst smart contracts on any chain.
- **Simplified Integration**: Streamlines the process for developers to create and connect new chains to existing networks.

# How It Works

## Cross-Chain AMM

Catalyst operates as a cross-chain AMM that only requires an interoperability messaging layer, enabling secure and fast cross-chain swaps.

## Unit of Liquidity (UoL)

UoL is an abstract representation of asset value that can be transferred between blockchains, acting as a standardized accounting mechanism for cross-chain swaps.

## Lightweight and Extensible

Catalyst is designed to be deployed on any chain, regardless of virtual machine or consensus mechanism, allowing for universal value transfer between Catalyst-enabled chains.

# Benefits

- Enables permissionless liquidity for new and existing chains
- Provides safe-by-design cross-chain transactions
- Offers a simple one-click transaction experience using native assets
- Supports capital-efficient liquidity provisioning
- Generates sustainable yield through MEV recapture

Catalyst empowers the modular blockchain future by dissolving barriers between chains and creating a global liquidity layer, facilitating seamless cross-chain interactions and fostering innovation in the blockchain ecosystem.
