# Socket 2.0

## What is Socket 2.0?

Socket 2.0 is a Chain Abstraction Protocol for Web3. It's a modular, extensible, and composable protocol that enables chain-agnostic applications by abstracting away the underlying complexity of different blockchains.

### Overview

Socket 2.0 revolutionizes blockchain interaction by focusing on Chain Abstraction rather than traditional Cross Chain operations. It allows users to interact with applications seamlessly across multiple networks without concerning themselves with the underlying blockchain infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Chain Abstraction**: Enables development of chain-agnostic applications.
- **Modular Order Flow Auction (MOFA)**: Creates an open marketplace for execution agents and user intents.
- **Seamless Cross-Chain Interaction**: Users can interact with applications on any supported chain effortlessly.
- **Best Execution**: Competitive marketplace ensures optimal execution of user requests.

# Chain Abstraction vs. Cross Chain

## Chain Abstraction

A higher-level concept that abstracts away the underlying chain, allowing for truly chain-agnostic applications.

## Cross Chain

Protocols designed to facilitate communication and asset transfer between different blockchains.

# How It Works

## Modular Order Flow Auction (MOFA)

- Creates an open marketplace for execution agents (transmitters) and user intents.
- Transmitters compete to settle user requests on-chain.
- Enables seamless interaction across supported networks.

# Benefits

- Simplifies blockchain interactions for users
- Enables developers to build chain-agnostic applications
- Provides best possible execution through competitive marketplace
- Abstracts away complexities of different blockchain networks

Socket 2.0 empowers developers to create truly chain-agnostic applications and provides users with a seamless experience across multiple blockchain networks, marking a significant advancement in blockchain interoperability and usability.
