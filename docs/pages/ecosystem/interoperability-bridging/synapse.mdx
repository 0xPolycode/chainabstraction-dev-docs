# Synapse

## What is Synapse?

Synapse is a widely used, extensible, and secure cross-chain communications network. It enables developers to build truly cross-chain applications using the Synapse Protocol.

### Overview

Synapse revolutionizes blockchain interoperability by providing a comprehensive suite of tools and networks for cross-chain communication and asset transfers. It comprises four core components that work together to create a robust cross-chain ecosystem.

## Key Components

- **Synapse Bridge**: Enables bridging of stables & ETH between 20 chains.
- **Synapse Interchain Network (SIN)**: An optimistic proof-of-stake interchain network.
- **Synapse Chain**: An Ethereum-based optimistic rollup built on the SYN OP stack.
- **Syn OP Stack**: A natively interchain rollup stack, built on Optimism's OP Stack.

# Synapse Interchain Network (SIN)

## What is SIN?

An optimistic proof-of-stake interchain network enabling trustless communication & settlement between chains.

## Key Features

- **Trustless**: Maintains network security with a single honest actor.
- **Permissionless**: Anyone can run an agent and support new chains.
- **Modular Security**: Customizable optimistic period for different use cases.

# Use Cases

## Chain Abstraction

Interact with smart contracts and dApps on any connected chain without switching networks.

## Unified Liquidity

Access total on-chain liquidity across multiple chains in a single transaction.

## Interchain Connectivity

Seamlessly connect blockchains, allowing new chains to onboard users, assets, and call smart contracts on any chain.

# Benefits

- Enables truly cross-chain applications
- Provides trustless and permissionless interchain communication
- Supports a wide range of use cases with modular security
- Facilitates unified liquidity across multiple chains
- Simplifies blockchain interactions for users and developers

Synapse empowers developers to create innovative cross-chain applications while providing users with seamless access to assets and dApps across multiple blockchain networks.
