# Across

## What is Across?

Across is an interoperability protocol powered by intents, enabling fast and low-cost value transfer across chains without compromising security. It's the only cross-chain intents protocol currently in production.

### Overview

Across revolutionizes blockchain interoperability by using an intents-based architecture. This approach solves the challenges faced by traditional message-passing protocols, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for cross-chain interactions.

## Key Features

- **Intents-based Architecture**: Users specify outcomes rather than execution paths.
- **Fast Transactions**: Enables quick asset transfers and cross-chain actions.
- **Low Cost**: Offers competitive fees for cross-chain operations.
- **Secure Settlement**: Utilizes a robust verification process for transaction settlement.

# How It Works

## Three-Layer System

1. **Request for Quote Mechanism**: Users express desired outcomes without specifying technical steps.
2. **Network of Competitive Relayers**: Decentralized network competing to fulfill orders.
3. **Settlement Layer**: Escrows funds, performs verification, and repays relayers.

## Intents vs. Message-Passing

- **Traditional Approach**: Message-passing between chains, facing speed, cost, and security challenges.
- **Across Solution**: Intents-based architecture with relayers for instant fulfillment and secure settlement.
