# Arcana Network

## What is Arcana Network?

Arcana Network is a Chain Abstraction Protocol powered by a Modular Layer 1. The protocol is designed to enable seamless intent-based interactions and transform the Web3 user experience. Arcana solution stack includes B2C wallets, and SDKs for wallets/applications integration.

## Overview of Arcana Chain Abstraction

The proliferation of 100s of chains (L1s, L2s, L3s, Appchains, Rollups, Sidechains..) has led to fragmented liquidity across chains. Arcana's Chain Abstraction protocol unifies your balance across chains and allows you to spend the entire balance on any app, any chain, without bridging, in one-click. Removing the friction of bridging with unified balances brings new users and liquidity to new chains and apps.

### Key Features

1. **Unified User Experience**
   - **Present a unified balance to the user to get started with their existing wallets and assets. showing an aggregate of balances held across chains.**
   - **Allow the user to instantly spend this balance on any chain.**
   - **Abstract away the need to switch or add chains.**
   - **Abstract away the need to hold gas tokens of a specific chain.**
   - **Support all types of wallets without forcing steep learning curves on users**

2. **Low Footprint Developer Experience**
   - Developers do not need to chase liquidity and users on different chains. Users can use the app without needing to bridge
   - Developers can choose chains based on tech and business requirements.
   - Developers aren't presented with high-effort and high-commitment integrations

3. **High Capital Efficiency**
   - **Utilise existing liquidity on the user's target chain to reduce the need for unnecessary bridging transactions.**
   - **Netting before rebalancing to improve capital efficiency, distribute the gains to all stakeholders and generate real yield for all the token holders and LPs/Solvers.**
