# Particle Network

## What is Particle Network?

[Particle Network](https://particle.network) is an account-level chain abstraction provider addressing Web3's fragmentation of users and liquidity through Universal Accounts. Particle's chain abstraction is powered by a Cosmos SDK L1 blockchain enabling the experience of a single account, balance, and address that can be used across all chains, allowing users to interact with any dApp and pay gas with any token.

In short: one account, one balance, any chain.

### Overview

Particle Network, known for its Wallet Abstraction solutions bringing social logins alongside [ERC-4337](/standards/4337) AA to the broader ecosystem, maintains an account-level technology, "Universal Accounts," existing solely to provide users with a consistent, chain-agnostic experience across the ecosystem. 

In essence, Universal Accounts consolidate balances across all chains, giving users constant access to a "universal" balance irrespective of the chains in which funds are held on.

## Key Components

- **Universal Liquidity**: Automatic (intent-based) bridging of assets across chains as needed to fund user operations.
- **Universal Gas**: Custom Paymaster implementation enabling the payment of gas in any asset, from any chain.
- **Universal Account**: The materialization of the two aforementioned components, leveraging smart accounts (ERC-4337) as the foundation.

# Features

## Gas Abstraction

Pay gas in any token, originating from any chain; removing the requirement for end-users to hold distinct gas tokens for each chain being used.

## Account Abstraction

Through the underlying usage of AA, signature simplification (multi-chain signatures, session keys, etc.), gasless (sponsored) transactions, and other features are used.

## Balance Consolidation

Universalization of balances across chains, allowing for transactions to be paid using any token held on any chain, providing users with a single balance usable anywhere.

## Developer Tools

Offers a robust set of APIs and SDKs for easy integration of abstraction features into dApps.

# Benefits

- Simplifies and enhances user experience, eliminating the need for users to pay mind to distinct chains
- Enables seamless cross-chain interactions
- Reduces friction for end-users, especially those new to blockchain
- Offers a secure environment for managing digital assets

Particle Network brings chain abstraction to the account-level through Universal Accounts, agnostifying users from the chains they're using.
