# Rhinestone

## What is Rhinestone?

Rhinestone builds infrastructure for modular smart accounts. They have pioneered the development of modular smart accounts, the interoperability through [ERC-7579](https://erc7579.com/) and security through the Module Registry. They are also the leading player in the development of resource locking on smart accounts. Resource locking allows solvers to gain security guarantees that the users' funds cannot be double spent but will instead be used to reimburse solvers that front capital.

### Chain Abstraction

Resource locking on both EOAs and smart accounts is a non-trivial problem, due to the ability for users to double spent. One key tradeoff is self-custody versus security guarantees for solvers. Rhinestone is building both smart account modules and offchain services to solve this problem.

## Core Features

- **Resource locks**: Rhinestone has pioneered the development of resource locking on smart accounts. Resource locking allows solvers to gain security guarantees that the users' funds cannot be double spent but will instead be used to reimburse solvers that front capital.
- **Smart account modules**: Through the use of smart account modules, Rhinestone allows users to bring their existing accounts and convert them into resource-lockable smart accounts that can be used for chain abstraction.
- **ERC-4337 abstraction**: Through offchain services, Rhinestone abstracts the complexity of ERC-4337 away from both wallets and solver networks, ensuring that both of these parties can focus on their core competencies.
