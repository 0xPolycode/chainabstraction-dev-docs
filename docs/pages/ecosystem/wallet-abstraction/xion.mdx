# XION

## What is XION?

XION is the first layer one blockchain purpose-built for consumer adoption through chain abstraction. It enables seamless user experiences for everyday users by abstracting away crypto complexities at the protocol level.

### Overview

XION revolutionizes blockchain interaction through its Generalized Chain Abstraction, which includes protocol-level abstractions across various aspects of blockchain technology. This comprehensive approach allows for the development of next-generation projects that bring Web3 to mainstream audiences worldwide.

## Key Features

- **Generalized Abstraction**: Unique protocol-level abstraction spanning multiple aspects of blockchain interaction.
- **Account Abstraction**: Pioneers modular account abstraction at the protocol level.
- **Signature Abstraction**: Supports signing across all current and future cryptographic curves.
- **Gas Abstraction**: Eliminates the concept of gas fees for end users.
- **Pricing Abstraction**: Utilizes familiar fiat-denominated pricing, eliminating asset volatility.
- **Abstracted Interoperability**: Extends chain abstraction to enable true cross-ecosystem interoperability.
- **Device Abstraction**: Provides safe and efficient operations across various devices.
- **Payment Abstraction**: Streamlines payments by eradicating traditional purchasing complexities.
