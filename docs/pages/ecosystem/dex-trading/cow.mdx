# CoW Protocol

CoW Protocol is a meta-DEX aggregation protocol that leverages trade intents and batch auctions to find users better prices for trading crypto assets across Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains.

# Overview

CoW Protocol uses a network of "solvers" to find optimal execution paths for trade intents. It groups intents into batches and searches for Coincidence of Wants (CoW) to offer the best prices, tapping into various liquidity sources.

# Benefits

- **Optimal Pricing**: Finds best prices through CoW and diverse liquidity sources
- **MEV Protection**: Batching mechanism helps protect against front-running
- **Liquidity Aggregation**: Acts as a meta-DEX aggregator
- **User-Centric Design**: Focuses on user protection and optimal execution
- **Permissionless**: Fully open protocol for trading

# Key Features

## Batch Auctions

Groups trade intents into batches to find Coincidence of Wants and optimize pricing.

## Solver Network

Relies on third-party solvers to find the best execution paths for trade intents.

CoW Protocol revolutionizes crypto asset trading by providing a user-protective, efficient meta-DEX aggregation solution leveraging innovative batch auction mechanisms.
