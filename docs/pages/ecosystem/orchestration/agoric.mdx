## What is Agoric?

Agoric is a Cosmos-based Layer 1 blockchain for building cross-chain smart contracts in JavaScript. The platformâ€™s asynchronous, multi-block architecture uniquely enables developers to orchestrate liquidity and services across the growing multi-chain universe, making Agoric ideal for building software with seamless user experiences. The native token BLD is used for staking and governance. The over-collateralized IST stable token is used to pay network fees.

### Overview

Agoric revolutionizes blockchain interaction and development by providing a comprehensive suite of tools and features for building decentralized applications. It addresses key challenges in the blockchain space, including cross-chain operability, gas fee complexity, and smart contract security, while leveraging the power of JavaScript to make blockchain development more accessible.
