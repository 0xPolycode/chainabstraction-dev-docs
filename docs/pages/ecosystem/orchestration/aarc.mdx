# AARC

## What is AARC?

AARC (Advanced Abstraction and Runtime Contracts) is a modular network designed for unified, omnichain decentralized applications (dApps). It enables developers to create chain-agnostic dApps that seamlessly unify users' accounts and liquidity from any blockchain without the complexities of multi-chain deployment.

### Overview

AARC revolutionizes blockchain interaction by providing a unified interface for multiple networks, simplifying gas payments, and enhancing account security. It empowers developers to build dApps that can function without chain-specific considerations, quickly accessing a multi-chain user base.

## Key Benefits

- **Omnichain Integration**: One integration allows dApps to go live on all supported chains (65+) without multiple deployments.
- **Rapid Development**: Go live in less than a week with Zerotouch integration, requiring no changes to existing smart contracts.
- **Chain Abstraction**: Enables seamless interaction across multiple blockchain networks.
- **Gas Abstraction**: Allows transactions using any supported token for gas fees across networks.
- **Account Abstraction**: Provides customizable smart contract-based wallets with enhanced security features.

# Features

## Unified dApp Deployment

AARC allows developers to deploy dApps across multiple chains without the need for separate deployments or contract modifications.

## Zerotouch Integration

Offers a zero-touch solution for dApp integration, requiring only SDK and API integration without changes to existing smart contracts.

## Cross-Chain Operability

Users can interact with multiple blockchain networks through a single, unified interface.

## Flexible Gas Payments

Enables gas fee payments using any supported token across various networks.

## Enhanced Account Security

Smart contract-based wallets offer customizable permissions, multi-signature support, and transaction limits.

## Developer Tools

Comprehensive suite of SDKs, APIs, and documentation to streamline omnichain dApp development.

# AARC Vision

AARC aims to create a future of integrated modularity, where liquidity, identity, and gas are unified across dApps, users, and chain ecosystems. We envision dApps operating seamlessly across all chains, transcending network-specific limitations.

# Core Principles

- **Permissionless and Modular**: Supporting fast, scalable development with modular systems.
- **Developer-Centric Approach**: Prioritizing user-friendly, efficient infrastructure for developers.
- **Agile Development**: Ensuring quick, quality delivery based on community and customer insights.

AARC empowers developers to create truly omnichain dApps, simplifying blockchain interactions and enhancing user experiences across the diverse Web3 ecosystem.
