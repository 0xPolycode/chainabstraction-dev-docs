# Khalani Network

## What is Khalani Network?

Khalani Network is a decentralized solvers infrastructure for intent-driven generative coordination in the blockchain ecosystem. It aims to revolutionize Web3 user experience through an intent-based approach to blockchain interactions.

### Overview

Khalani Network innovates by shifting from traditional transaction-based interactions to intent-centric interactions. This approach allows users to specify desired outcomes rather than authorizing specific execution paths, making blockchain interactions more intuitive and user-friendly.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Solver Infrastructure**: Enables collaborative solving among specialized agents.
- **Intent-Driven Interactions**: Allows users to specify outcomes instead of execution paths.
- **Cooperative Model**: Encourages solver cooperation over competition.
- **Modular Architecture**: Built with three main components for flexibility and efficiency.

# Core Components

## Intent Compatibility Layer

Normalizes and publishes externally sourced intents for Khalani solvers.

## Validity and Validity VM (VVM)

A language and runtime for general-purpose intent processing with deterministic settlement guarantees.

## Universal Settlement Layer

Enables atomic and multi-domain settlements into various intent systems.

# Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: Simplifies blockchain interactions for users.
- **Enhanced Expressiveness**: Allows for more flexible and customizable user preferences.
- **Reduced Centralization**: Promotes a more decentralized solver ecosystem.
- **Lower Barriers**: Eases the process of deploying and operating solvers.

# Solving Key Challenges

## Centralization Prevention

Encourages collaboration over competition among solvers.

## Expressive Intent Support

Enables complex, cross-application intents without compromising infrastructure resilience.

## Accessibility

Lowers the barrier for new solvers to enter the ecosystem.

Khalani Network is poised to transform the blockchain interaction paradigm, offering a more intuitive, efficient, and decentralized approach to executing user intents across various blockchain ecosystems.
