# Astria

## What is Astria?

Astria is a decentralized sequencing layer designed to be shared among multiple rollups. It provides a unified platform for sequencing, data availability, and verification for various rollups in the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Overview

Astria revolutionizes the rollup infrastructure by offering a shared sequencing layer that decouples execution from consensus. This approach enhances flexibility for rollup developers and improves overall efficiency in the multi-rollup ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Sequencing**: Uses CometBFT for consensus among sequencer nodes.
- **Lazy Sequencing**: Sequences and commits data, delaying execution until necessary.
- **Data Availability**: Publishes sequenced data via Celestia.
- **Flexible Rollup Integration**: Allows rollups to easily fetch and verify sequenced data.

# Core Components

## Astria Sequencer Network

- Implements decentralized leader selection and single-slot finality.
- Uses CometBFT (formerly Tendermint) as the consensus algorithm.
- Supports IBC (inter-blockchain communication) capabilities.

## Conductor

- Works similarly to existing rollup "consensus nodes".
- Obtains, verifies, and derives transactions for specific rollups.
- Remains agnostic to rollup-specific transaction formats and state transition functions.

## Sequencer Application Logic

- Implements three main functions:
 1. Sequencing of rollup data
 2. Value transfers
 3. Validator set changes

# Key Functionalities

## Data Sequencing

- Sequences arbitrary data for usage by multiple rollups.
- Creates commitments to rollup data for each `rollup_id`.

## Data Availability

- Makes sequenced data available via Celestia.
- Supports data availability sampling through light nodes.

## Rollup Integration

- Allows rollups to fetch only necessary data.
- Enables verification of data commitments against sequencer finalization.

# Benefits

- Enhances scalability by sharing sequencing resources among multiple rollups.
- Provides flexibility for rollup developers in terms of execution logic.
- Improves efficiency through lazy sequencing and shared infrastructure.
- Enables potential inter-rollup communication through IBC support.

Astria aims to create a more efficient and scalable infrastructure for the multi-rollup ecosystem, offering shared sequencing services while maintaining flexibility for individual rollup designs.
