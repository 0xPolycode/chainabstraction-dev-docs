# AggLayer

The AggLayer is an in-development interoperability protocol that allows for trustless, cross-chain token transfers and message-passing, as well as more complex operations. The safety of the AggLayer is provided by ZK proofs.

The AggLayer currently connects chains built with Polygon CDK, a developer toolkit for designing ZK-powered Layer 2s. The long term goal for the protocol is to be flexible enough to provide interoperability among a growing range of blockchain architectures, including L2s, appchains, and non-EVM chains. 

## Overview

Polygon envisions a unified multichain ecosystem of ZK-powered Ethereum L2s. The Knowledge Layer supports this vision by providing essential resources, while the AggLayer facilitates seamless cross-chain interactions.

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Enables elastic scaling of Ethereum L2s
- **Unification**: Creates a seamless multichain ecosystem
- **Interoperability**: Facilitates cross-chain transactions and messaging
- **Security**: Leverages ZK proofs for trustless off-chain computation
