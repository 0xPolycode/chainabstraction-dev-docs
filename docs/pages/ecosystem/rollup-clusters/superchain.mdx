# What is the Superchain?

The Superchain is a network of L2 chains (OP Chains) that share security, a communication layer, and an open-source technology stack. It aims to create a unified, scalable blockchain ecosystem on Ethereum, enabling developers to build applications that abstract away underlying chains.

## Overview

The Superchain concept represents the next major scalability improvement to the OP Stack after Bedrock. It merges OP Mainnet and other chains into a single unified network of OP Chains, marking a significant step towards bringing scalable and decentralized compute to the world.

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Enables horizontal scaling through multiple interconnected chains
- **Unification**: Creates a seamless multi-chain ecosystem with shared properties
- **Standardization**: Allows chains to be treated as interchangeable compute resources
- **Security**: Leverages Ethereum's security model across all OP Chains
- **Flexibility**: Supports various chain configurations while maintaining standardization

## Key Features

### Shared L1 Blockchain

Provides a total ordering of transactions across all OP Chains

### Shared Bridge

Enables standardized security properties for all OP Chains

### Cheap OP Chain Deployment

Allows deploying and transacting on OP Chains without high L1 fees

### Configurable OP Chains

Enables customization of data availability providers, sequencer addresses, and more

### Secure Cross-Chain Interactions

Facilitates safe state migration between OP Chains

## Vision

The Superchain aims to realize the vision of a truly scalable blockchain ecosystem, enabling developers to build applications without worrying about underlying infrastructure while maintaining the security and decentralization principles of Ethereum.
