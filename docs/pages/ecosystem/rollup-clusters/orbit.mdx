# Arbitrum and Arbitrum Orbit

# What is Arbitrum?

Arbitrum is a technology suite designed to scale Ethereum. It allows users to perform Ethereum transactions and use Web3 apps with lower fees and faster processing times. Arbitrum Rollup, the flagship product, is an Optimistic rollup protocol that inherits Ethereum-level security.

## Overview

Arbitrum solves Ethereum's scalability issues by acting as a Layer 2 solution. It uses optimistic rollups to process transactions off-chain while still leveraging Ethereum's security. This approach significantly increases transaction throughput and reduces costs.

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Enables higher transaction throughput than Ethereum Layer 1
- **Cost-efficiency**: Reduces transaction fees for users
- **Security**: Inherits Ethereum's security model
- **Compatibility**: Highly compatible with existing Ethereum tools and dApps
- **Flexibility**: Offers different chain types to suit various needs (Rollup and AnyTrust)

## Key Features

### Optimistic Rollups

Processes transactions off-chain and posts compressed data to Ethereum

### Fraud Proofs

Ensures security by allowing disputes to be resolved on Ethereum Layer 1

### Ethereum Compatibility

Supports existing Ethereum wallets, libraries, and tools

### Multiple Chain Types

Offers Rollup (Arbitrum One) and AnyTrust (Arbitrum Nova) chains

## Arbitrum Orbit

Arbitrum Orbit is a permissionless solution for launching customizable chains using Arbitrum technology. It allows developers to create Layer 2 or Layer 3 chains with configurable components such as throughput, privacy, gas token, and governance.

### Key Features of Orbit

- Customizable chain parameters
- Support for Layer 2 (settling to Ethereum) or Layer 3 (settling to other L2s like Arbitrum One)
- Leverages Arbitrum Nitro technology stack
- Allows chain owners to determine governance structure

## Vision

Arbitrum provides scalable solutions for Ethereum, offering both public chains (Arbitrum One and Nova) and customizable private chains (Orbit) to meet diverse project needs while maintaining strong security and Ethereum compatibility.
