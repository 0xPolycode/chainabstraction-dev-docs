# Understanding ERC-7579: Minimal Modular Smart Accounts

## What is ERC-7579?

### Definition and Core Concepts

ERC-7579 outlines the **minimally** required interfaces and behavior for modular smart accounts and modules to ensure **interoperability** across implementations. Modular smart accounts allow developers to easily build features to extend smart accounts instead of being required to build the entire account from scratch, duplicating work and diminishing the benefits of battle-tested code.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Standardized execution behavior**: ERC-7579 defines the core interfaces and behavior that smart accounts should implement to ensure interoperability across different implementations.
- **Standardized account configuration**: The standard specifies how smart accounts should be configured and how modules can be added or removed from an account. Further, it also standardizes core account configuration options.
- **Standardized module interfaces and behavior**: ERC-7579 defines the interfaces that modules should implement to be used by smart accounts and how they should interact with the account.

## Ecosystem adoption

ERC-7579 has been widely adopted by both existing and new smart account players in the ecosystem. Below, we list some of the projects that have adopted ERC-7579:

Accounts:

- Safe
- ZeroDev Kernel
- Biconomy Nexus
- Etherspot

Tooling:

- Pimlico's Permissionless.js
- Rhinestone's various tools
- Etherspot's Modular SDK

Modules:

- Rhinestone's core modules
- zkEmail social recovery
- Klaster chain abstraction

Applications:

- WalletConnect smart sessions

... and many more!

## Summary

ERC-7579 is a standard for modular smart accounts that aims to provide the minimally required interfaces and sets of behavior that allows for smart account interoperability while allowing account builders to continue innovating. It is currently supported by the likes of Safe, Biconomy, ZeroDev, WalletConnect, OKX, Rhinestone, Pimlico, Etherspot, zkEmail and more.
